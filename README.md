 This repository was created the same day I created my personal canon.
 <blockquote> It is my desire and my duty to engineer software that is a delight for users to use and maintainers to manage. To do this I must understand and use the most useful and prolific software engineering tools, and work deeply for long uninterrupted  periods. I am committed to a life of radically deep work and focus.<blockquote>
